<h2  style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:100%">Gaming Life:<br><br>
<p2 style="color:antiquewhite; text-align:left; font-size:100%">Ever since I was a little kid I was addicted to gaming on both consoles and on the PC.  From my first console, the Playstation 1, to my current console the Xbox one S, I have always devoted most of my time to developing my gaming skills in order to play competitively among the gaming community.  My deep interest and devotion to the gaming scene is what developed my current life goal of becoming a computer scientist and eventually into a game developer and security designer.</p><br>
<h3  style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:100%">Music Life:<br><br>
<p3 style="color:antiquewhite; text-align:left; font-size:100%">Ever since the 5th grade I took an affinity to playing in my school bands.  I always wanted to be a trumpeteer but when it came to choosing the instrument I would use for the next 13 years of my life it would ultimately be the Clarinet.  Whether it be learning musical score or listening to the lastest hits on the top 100 bilboards, music has always been a major influence in my life.  Music allowed me to view the world in a different light.  It also allowed me to better myself whether it be through improvement of grades or becoming more sociable with others around me.  Music will always be a major part of my life.<br><br>
<h4  style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:100%">School Life:<br><br>
<p4 style="color:antiquewhite; text-align:left; font-size:100%">Since I love technology and the multitude of aspects involved with using programming to develop games and security systems I chose to major in Computer sience here at FAU.  My goal is to graduate with my bachelors in CS, join the Airforce, then seek a masters in either game development or crypto.  If I had unlimited resources in order to create something new I would use it to develop a game world in which immersion would be at 100% in such a way that would render VR useless and where the controller and console is your mind.
